# Command Reference

The `butterfly` CLI allows you to run your migrations. It has three commands:
- `butterfly up` will run all migrations that haven't been run yet.
- `butterfly revert` will revert the latest migration.
- `butterfly refresh` will revert all migrations and run them again.

All of these commands require a `DATABASE_URL` variable, in the same form as the URI passed to [`connect`](connecting).

That's about it!
